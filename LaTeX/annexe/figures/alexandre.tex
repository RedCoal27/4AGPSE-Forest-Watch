\subsubsection*{Maillet Alexandre}
As a member of the team responsible for the design and implementation of an autonomous system for taking pictures of a tropical forest in Gabon for research purposes, I was responsible for the alimentation part of the system. My role in the project included the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Alimentation system design: I have gained experience in designing an alimentation system that meets the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as the use of a 12V 2,3Ah lead battery, a 10w solar panel, a sun voltage regulator, and a LM317 to regulate the voltage to approximately 8V.
\item Voltage regulation: I have improved my skills in using LM317 and other regulators to ensure that the voltage supplied to the camera and microcontroller is within the proper range.
\item Project management: I have gained experience in working in a team and coordinating with other members to ensure that the alimentation system is completed on schedule.
\item Communication: I have improved my ability to communicate my ideas and designs effectively to the rest of the team, and to explain the reasoning behind my design choices.
\end{itemize}

Although my contribution to the project was significant, I believe that we could have worked harder on the project. I think that if we put more effort into it, we could have improved the final product even more. Nevertheless, I believe that my experience in this project will be valuable in future projects, both in terms of technical skills and experience in project management.\\
