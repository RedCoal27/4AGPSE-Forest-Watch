I was part of the team that worked on the design and implementation of an autonomous system for taking pictures of a tropical forest in Gabon for research purposes. As a member of the team, I was responsible for the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Product design: I have gained experience in designing a product that meets the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as durability, waterproofing, ventilation, and ease of access.
    \item Technical drawing and 3D modeling: I have improved my skills in using technical drawing software and 3D modeling software to create detailed and accurate designs of the case.
    \item Project management: I have gained experience in working in a team and coordinating with other members to ensure that the design of the case is completed on schedule.
    \item Communication: I have improved my ability to communicate my ideas and designs effectively to the rest of the team, and to explain the reasoning behind my design choices.
\end{itemize}

Overall, I believe that my contribution to the design of the case has been significant, and I am proud of the final product. I believe that my experience in this project will be valuable in future projects, both in terms of technical skills and experience in project management.\\
