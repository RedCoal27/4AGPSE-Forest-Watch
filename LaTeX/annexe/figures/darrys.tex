% While working on this project, I contributed on many aspects:
% •	Research: In this project, I took part on research about components and methods. For example, I researched components to buy for the project alongside other team members. I also made research on how remote shutter systems work to reproduce it.

% •	Project management: This project permitted me to improve my skills in project management and communication with my colleagues. 

% •	Documentation: While writing documentation for the project, it helped me to better understand what my colleagues were doing and to write technical documents. I also documented what we were doing each time we were working on the project.
