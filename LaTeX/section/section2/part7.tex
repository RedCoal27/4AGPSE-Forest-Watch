\subsection{The shutter system}
\label{shutter}
The shutter system is a sub-system allowing the microcontroller to command the camera. This system was developed with the help of video tutorials dismantling commercial remote shutters, showing that they were mainly made of resistances.

The system is made of a jack socket, connected to resistances. The shutter and the focus pin are linked to the microcontroller. The microcontroller can then be programmed to put the pins at a high or a low state to trigger the shutter or the focus of the camera. By controlling transistor, the camera sees a change in the resistor and trigger the associated actions.
