\begin{itemize}[label=]
    \item C1.1: Calibrating internal camera.
    \item C1.2: Taking pictures twice a day.
    \item C1.3: Taking good quality pictures from 300 meters.
    \item C2: The system can stay autonomous for one year.
    \item C3.1: The system has 16 Go of space to store pictures.
